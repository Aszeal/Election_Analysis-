## Election Audit Summary
### The script is highly versitle and can be retro-fitted to meet various need of any election.

  -For example,  we can modify the script to be used to track the "smallest county" by changing the script to look like the following:
  ```
  smallest_county = empty string   
  smallest_county_count = 0
  ```
